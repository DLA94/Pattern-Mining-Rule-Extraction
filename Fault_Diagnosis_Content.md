In this thesis, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used to build a condition monitoring system that has incremental learning capabilities. Two incremental learning algorithms are implemented, the first method uses Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) algorithm and the second uses Learn++ algorithm. In addition, intelligent agents and multi-agent systems are used to build a condition monitoring system that is able to accommodate various analysis techniques.
